# -DataScienceEcosystem-IBM
Objective: In this final assignment,I will: Create a Jupyter Notebook Insert code and markdown cells Share your notebook through GitHub

Exercise 1: Create a Jupyter Notebook Create a new Jupyter notebook called DataScienceEcosystem.ipynb

Note: The next item in the course will launch JupyterLite with an empty notebook with this name that you can use to complete the rest of the exercises. You can also use any other Jupyter notebook environment (e.g., Anaconda) that you prefer to complete the assignment.

Exercise 2: Create markdown cell with title of the notebook Create a markdown cell with the title Data Science Tools and Ecosystem using the H1 style heading. Take a screenshot of the markdown cell and name it as 2-title.png (Images can be saved with either the.jpg or.png extension.)

Exercise 3: Create a markdown cell for an introduction Write an introductory sentence about the notebook, such as the following: In this notebook, data science tools and ecosystems are summarized. Take a screenshot of the markdown cell and name it as 3-intro.png (Images can be saved with either the.jpg or.png extension.)

Exercise 4: Create a markdown cell to list data science languages Start the cell with an overview line, such as: Some of the popular languages that data scientists use are: Then create an ordered list (i.e., numbered) listing three (or more) commonly used languages for data science. Take a screenshot of the markdown cell and name it as 4-dslanguages.png (Images can be saved with either the.jpg or.png extension.)

Exercise 5: Create a markdown cell to list data science libraries Add an overview line to the cell, like: Some of the commonly used libraries used by data scientists include: Below this line, add an ordered list listing three (or more) commonly used libraries in data science. Take a screenshot of the markdown cell and name it as 5-dslibraries.png (Images can be saved with either the.jpg or.png extension.)

Exercise 6: Create a markdown cell with a table of Data Science tools Create a single-column table in this cell with the first row containing the header Data Science Tools. The subsequent three rows in the table should indicate three development environments for open-source tools used in data science. Take a screenshot of the markdown cell and name it as 6-dstools.png (Images can be saved with either the.jpg or.png extension.) Hint: Refer to Lab: Using Markdowns in Jupyter Notebooks to Create a Table.

Exercise 7: Create a markdown cell introducing arithmetic expression examples Add a line in this cell with an H3-style heading and text like: Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python. Take a screenshot of the markdown cell and name it as 7-introarithmetic.png (Images can be saved with either the.jpg or.png extension.)

Exercise 8: Create a code cell to multiply and add numbers In this code cell, evaluate the expression (3*4)+5. Insert a comment line before the expression to explain the operation, e.g. This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply, then add integers. Then execute the cell to ensure the expression returns the expected output of 17. Take a screenshot of the code cell with output and name it as 8-multiplyandaddintegers.png (Images can be saved with either the.jpg or.png extension.)

Exercise 9: Create a code cell to convert minutes to hours In this code cell, write an expression that converts 200 minutes into hours. Insert a comment line before the expression to explain the operation, e.g. This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing 60. Run the cell to evaluate the expression. Take a screenshot of the code cell with output and name it as 9-hourstominutes.png (Images can be saved with either the.jpg or.png extension.)

Exercise 10: Insert a markdown cell to list Objectives Below the introduction cell created in Exercise 3, insert a new markdown cell to list the objectives that this notebook covered (i.e., some of the key takeaways from the course). In this new cell, start with an introductory line titled Objectives, in bold font. Then, using an unordered list (bullets), indicate 3â€“5 items covered in this notebook, such as the list of popular languages for data science. Take a screenshot of the markdown cell and name it as 10-objectives.png (Images can be saved with either the.jpg.jpg or.png extension.)

Exercise 11: Create a markdown cell to indicate the Author's name In this markdown cell, include the following text: Author in the H2 style heading. Include your name as regular text below the word author. Take a screenshot of the markdown cell and name it as 11-authordetails.png (Images can be saved with either the.jpg.jpg or.png extension.) Note: Save and download the notebook.

Exercise 12: Share your notebook through GitHub Upload your notebook to a public repository on GitHub.

Exercise 13: -Take a screenshot of the first page of the notebook and save it as 1-notebook.png(Images can be saved with either the.jpg or.png extension.)
